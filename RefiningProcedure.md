# Procedure for Gleaning Gold-Standard Binary Data Files
1) Dump the same chip 5 separate times into different .bin files
2) Take a copy of the first file and mark as "BASE" for the file that will be directly edited to the most democratic data
3) The first file is now a reference backup
4) Diff the BASE against all other 4 files and mark the areas that are different
5) Manually go through the marked changes in BASE and change each region to the most agreed-upon answer (5-grade refined)
6) Repeat steps 1-5 with another copy of the same cartridge
7) Take these two refined files and copy the first one as "GS"
8) Diff the GS against the other file. If the diff does not reveal any point-changes, you have been successful (10-grade refined)
9) The resulting GS is the gold-standard if it passed step 8.
10) If step 8 reveals any changes, this will have to be investigated for a certain specific stamp or wiring difficulty. Alternatively, the .bin could also be diffed with another GS if the variable region is fixed.
