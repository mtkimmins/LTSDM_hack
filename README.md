### What this Repository Contains
- **Cartridge dumping** workflows (noise reduction, repeatability, verification)
- **Container/region parsing** + documented hypotheses about pointers/regions/maps
- **Audio pipeline experiments** (e.g., suspected ADPCM/codec investigations)
- **Hardware notes** for reading cartridges (breakouts/shields, wiring, voltage sanity)

## Wanted
- additional **cartridge dumps** (with hashes + metadata)
- **format validation** (pointer table / region boundaries)
- codec identification (ADPCM variants, framing, sample rates)
- firmware analysis / instrumentation notes
